Quick sort is a type of sorthing algorithm that implements the structure of the binary search tree
Binary search tress have ther left subtrees less than the root whilt the right sub trees greater than the root

Quick sorte impliments this arrangement in the array such that the elements the left of the lead (mostly known as 
the pivot) are less and the elements on the right of the pivot are greater

the pivot is chossen at random in array, it can be any element in the array

this is also applied to sub arrays
